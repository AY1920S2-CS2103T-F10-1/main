The following diagrams are used in my Developerâ€™s Guides:

== 1. UI class diagram:

image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

* This diagram models different UI components and their relations with one another. The UI of our ResuMe application
consists of a `MainWindow` which has a navigability relationship with `Logic` so as to update the UI according to commands
executed by `Logic`. The `MainWindow` is started up by `UiManager` and fill up the main display with all components upon
starting the application. Overall, the `MainWindow` composes of a `HelpWindow`, a `CommandBox`, a `StatusBarFooter`, a `ResultDisplay`
panel, an `ItemDisplayList` panel, an `ItemListPanel`, a `NoteListPanel` and an `UserOverallPane` panel.
The `ItemListPanel` is a placeholder with navigability relationship with multiple `ItemCard`, while `NoteListPanel` is a placeholder
with navigability relationship with multiple `NoteCard`. Meanwhile, the `UserOverallPane` composes of a `UserDetailPane`
and a `UserProfilePane`. All these components extends an `{abstract}UiPart` so as to load the matching `fxml` files that are
in `src/main/resources/view` folder. Lastly, since `ItemCard`, `NoteCard` and `UserOverallPane` requires items from `Model`
such as `Internship`, `Project`, `Skill`, `Resume`, `Note`, `Person`, they are thus dependent on `Model`.

* A class diagram is used in this case because it can model and describe the relationship between all classes in the entire
UI component. As the concern is not with a specific command execution of the program, the class diagram is appropriate in this
case to model the UI of *ResuMe*.

== 2. `me` command sequence diagram:

* This diagram models the `me` command when user wants to update his/her user profile. Upon a command such as `me n/Quoc Hung` is
typed in by the user, LogicManager will execute the command text. The `ResumeBookParser` then parses this command text in order to
identify what command it is. In this case, a new `EditUserParser` is created as the parser identifies that this is an `EditUserCommand`.
The `EditUserParser` will then parse the arguments provided to create an `EditUserDescriptor` object for editing and identify that this is an
`EditUserCommand`. Hence, an `EditUserCommand` is created which takes in the `EditUserDescriptor`. After this, `EditUserCommand` will
`execute()` by getting `userToEdit` from `Model` with method `getUser()` in `Model` and create a new `editedUser` with the updated fields.
The `Model` then sets existing user to a new user with `setUser(editedUser)`. After this, an `EditUserCommandResult` is
created in `EditUserCommand` which will be returned to update relevant Ui parts.

* This sequence diagram is appropriate in modelling the entire command sequence for `me` command as it is slightly different from
other `EditCommand` with the absence of an index due to a single user `Person` in `Model`.

== 3. Edit note activity diagram:

image::EditNoteCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

* This activity diagram models the execution of the `EditNoteCommand`. Upon being executed, if the index provided by user is
non-positive and out of bound, then an invalid index exception will be thrown and the execution terminates. If the index provided
is valid, then `Model` will get the note with matching index and a new edited note will be created in `EditNoteCommand`.
Upon this, if the edited note is already present in the `ResumeBook`, then a duplicate note exception will be thrown. Else,
the `Model` will update this note to its edited version in `ResumeBook`. `ResumeBook` is committed for `undo/redo` actions
and the edited note is displayed according in the Ui note list. After the branch, an according result message is displayed
to user.

* This activity diagram is chosen to model `EditNoteCommand` as I have already included a sequence diagram for `me` command
which is mostly similar in execution. However, since the `EditNoteCommand` is now concerned with an index as well as whether
the note is edited to an existing note in `ResumeBook` which is not desired, the use of activity diagram with guard conditions is
more appropriate in this case.
