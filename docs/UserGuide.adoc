== Introduction

Hello fellow University friends! Have you ever found writing resumes
for job and internship applications a hassle? Have you ever dreamt about
an app that can help you manage different resumes for different companies?
Have you ever wished for a more streamlined *Command Line Interface*
application that can match your efficiency and typing prowess?

If this sounds like you, *ResuMe* is _the_ resume managing application for you!
Made by University students for University students with _looovee_, this wonder
understands your struggle and strives to cater to your specific resume needs
and job application woes.

=== Overview
*ResuMe* allows the management of four different item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="10%,10%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Item type |Alias |Attributes
|1 |internship |int |name, role, from, to, description, tag

|2 |project |proj |name, time, website, description, tag

|3 |skill |ski |name, level, tag

|4 |resume |res |name, description, tag
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different resumes as well!
(As if this is not the whole reason why we decided to build this app :))
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different resumes.

=== Preview
The following is the GUI for our application:

== About this guide
Our aim when writing this document is to help you - a new user - get started with *ResuMe* as quickly as possible.
The guide features all the available commands, their syntax, as well as specific examples for illustration.

This section is, well... a guide on how to use this guide :) We will be explaining some of the symbols and formatting used, key terms,
as well notes and tips for a better user experience.

=== Symbols and Formatting
Most of us are visual learners, and we figured, what is a better way to present information than using some shapes and colours?

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Symbol / Format|Explanation
|NOTE: | Important information to take note
|TIP: | Tips
|WARNING: | Warnings on potential misuse
|`consola font` | Keywords you could type in the command box and could be be executed by the application
|=======================================================================

=== Key terms
You will come across these little guys a lot in this document, so let's get to know them first!
[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Explanation
|`type` | Consisting of four different types: `internship`, `project`, `skill` or `resume`
|`item` | An item stored in the application, which could be any one of the four types above
|`command` | A line of text that you could type into the command box and execute
|`parameter` | Specific information about an `item` supplied by you
|`index` | The position of the `item` in the currently displayed list
|=======================================================================



****
The GUI includes:

1. Command box: where you enter your commands.

2. Result box: where the result of a command is shown. It can show a success message or a failure
message if something wrong happens.

3. View box: where the detailed information is shown if needed. For instance, if you are viewing an
internship item, this box shows in full the item's name, timing, description, and other pieces of information.

4. List box: where all items of a type are listed. Only a type is displayed at a time. You can change
the view of this list. Also, when a command results in the change of one or more items of an item type,
the list box will be set to displaying that type.

5. User box: where you can view your information like name, email address, or phone number. If you make any update
that change will be reflected.
****

`TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[\#/ TAG]...`
can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `#/ friend`, `\#/ friend`, `#/ family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE`,

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the ResuMe application.

****
Format: `delete INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

`INDEX` : the positional index of the item. Use `list TYPE` with the same item type to view this list.

`TYPE`  : the item type.

[NOTE]
The `INDEX` argument comes before the `TYPE` argument.

[TIP]
Use `list` command to navigate to the correct list to ensure that 1) the item exists, and 2) you know the
correct index for deletion. Or just fall back on `undo`.

Deleting an item will set the list window to display items of its type.
If the item is an internship, a project, or a skill, all resumes that contain it will also be updated to
reflect the change.

Examples:

* `delete 2 i/ res` +
Deletes the 2nd resume in the resume book.

=== Editing a resume: `redit`
Edits the resume to contain the items specified in the command.

[NOTE]
`redit` is a different command from `edit`. Please visit <<FAQ>> for more information.

****
Format: `redit RESUME_INDEX TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...]]`
****

* For each `TYPE`, existing items will be updated to the input items.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a resume by chaining
`ITEM_INDEX` after `TYPE/`  e.g. `proj/ 3 6`, will add item of indices 3 and 6.
* You can remove all items of type `TYPE` by
typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_INDEX` after it.

Examples:

* `redit res/ 1 int/ 1 proj/ 1 ski/ 1 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain the internship item at index 1, project item at index 1, and skill item at indices 1 and 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditAddIntoResume.png[][AddIntoResume,442,337]


* `redit res/ 1 int/ proj/ ski/` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain no internship, project, and skill items. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditRemoveEverything.png[][RemoveEverything,442,337]

* `redit res/ 1 int/ 1 proj/ ski/ 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain internship item at index 1, no project items, and skill item at index 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen (take note that initially the resume may contain other set of items entirely):

image::ReditWantSomeThings.png[][WantSomeThings,442,337]

===== Tag Pull
(To be implemented) Edits the resume specified at that index to contain all items of the specified tag.

=== Undo a command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.

****
Format: undo
****

Commands that can be undone are: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, and `me`.

Successive undo commands will bring the application further back, until there is no more change to undo.

[NOTE]
--
* An undo is done per command and not change.

* Commands that make no change to the application state, like `list` or `view`, cannot be undone.

* You cannot undo if there is no previous state to return to.

of that command.

****
Format: redo
****

[NOTE]
--
* A redo is done per command and not change.

* If a new `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, or `me` command is performed after an undo, then all redo states will be deleted and you will not be able to go
to these states.
* You cannot redo if there is no forward state to go to.

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a .pdf file from an existing resume stored inside the application at the specified index.

The exported `.pdf` file
will be located in the same folder as the application `.jar` file.

[NOTE]
A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing resume.

****
Format: `rgen INDEX [n/ FILENAME]`
****

[TIP]
It is optional to specify a `FILENAME` for the .pdf file.
If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 2 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all resumes. Assuming that you want to generate the first resume in the list.
