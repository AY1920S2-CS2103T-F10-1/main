== Introduction

Hello fellow University friends! Have you ever found writing resumes
for job and internship applications a hassle? Have you ever dreamt about
an app that can help you manage different resumes for different companies?
Have you ever wished for a more streamlined *Command Line Interface*
application that can match your efficiency and typing prowess?

If this sounds like you, *ResuMe* is _the_ resume managing application for you!
Made by University students for University students with _looovee_, this wonder
understands your struggle and strives to cater to your specific resume needs
and job application woes.

=== Overview
*ResuMe* allows the management of five different item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="^.^10%,^.^10%,^.^20%,.^60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Item type |Alias |Attributes
|1 |internship |int |name, role, from, to, description, tag

|2 |project |proj |name, time, website, description, tag

|3 |skill |ski |name, level, tag

|4 |resume |res |name, description, tag

|5 |note |note |name, time
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different resumes as well!
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different resumes.

=== Preview
The following is the GUI for our application:

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

****
The GUI includes:

. *Command box:* where you enter your commands.

. *Result box:* where the result of a command is shown. It can show a success message or a failure
message if something wrong happens.

. *View box:* where the detailed information about an item is shown. For instance, if you are viewing an
`internship` item, this box shows in full the `company name`, `role`, `from`, `to`, `description` and `tags`.

. *List box:* where all items of a type are listed. Only one type is displayed at a time. You can change
the view of this list using `list` command. Additionally, when other commands change items of a type,
the list box will be set to display that type.

. *User box:* where you can view your personal information like name, email address, or phone number. Any changes made
to your user profile will be automatically reflected here.

== About this guide
Our aim when writing this document is to help you - a new user - get started with *ResuMe* as quickly as possible.
The guide features all the available commands, their syntax, as well as specific examples for illustration.

This section is, well... a guide on how to use this guide :) We will be explaining some of the symbols and formatting used, key terms,
as well notes and tips for a better user experience.

=== Symbols and Formatting

Most of us are visual learners, and we figured, what is a better way to present information than using some shapes and colours?

[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Symbol / Format|Explanation
|icon:info-circle[role="blue"] | Important information to take note
|icon:lightbulb-o[role="yellow"] | Tips
|icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] | Warnings on potential misuse
|`consola font` | Keywords you could type in the command box and could be be executed by the application
|=======================================================================

=== Key terms
You will come across these little guys a lot in this document, so let's get to know them first!
[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Explanation
|`type` | Consisting of five different types: `internship`, `project`, `skill`, `resume` or `note`
|`item` | An item stored in the application, which could be any one of the five types above
|`command` | A line of text that you could type into the command box and execute
|`parameter` | Specific information about an `item` supplied by you
|`index` | The position of the `item` in the currently displayed list
|=======================================================================

// end::guide[]

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `resumebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `ResuMe` application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try out these example commands:

* **`list`**`i/ res` : lists all resumes
* **`add`**`i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/SE #frontend`: adds a resume named `Software Engineering Resume`.
* **`delete`**`1 i/ res` : deletes the 1st resume shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the you. +
For example in `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME`, `TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be customised to be `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. +
 For example, `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
 For example, `[\#/ TAG]...` can be used as:
** (i.e. 0 times)
** `#/ friend`
** `#/ friend #/ family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
 For example, if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE`, `p/ PHONE_NUMBER n/ NAME` is also acceptable.

_(refer to <<Generating a resume: `rgen`>> for more details)_

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `add i/ proj n/ Duke t/ 06-2020 w/ abc.github.io d/ For a little module named CS2103T. #/ java #/ tech`

*Outcome:*

. All project items are listed in the list panel.
+

[NOTE]
`edit` is a different command from `redit`. Please visit <<FAQ>> for more information.

**Format:**

****
`edit INDEX i/ TYPE [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
****


[width="100%",cols="^16%,84%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format

=== Finding items by name: `find`

Finds items in the ResuMe application whose names contain the specified keyword(s).

[NOTE]
An item could be one of the four item types: `internship`, `project`, `skill` or even a `resume` itself.

**Format:**

****
`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ TYPE`
****

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="^12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ int`

|Project |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ proj`

|Skill |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ ski`

|Resume |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/res`

. `find Duke i/ proj`

*Outcome*

. Projects with matching name with keywords are listed in the list panel.
+
image::find_command.png[width="790"]

// tag::delete[]

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the ResuMe application.

**Format:**

****
`delete INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

`INDEX` : the positional index of the item. Use `list TYPE` with the same item type to view this list.

`TYPE`  : the item type.

[NOTE]
The `INDEX` argument comes before the `TYPE` argument.

[TIP]
Use `list` command to navigate to the correct list to ensure that 1) the item exists, and 2) you know the
correct index for deletion. Or just fall back on `undo`.

Deleting an item will set the list window to display items of its type.
If the item is an internship, a project, or a skill, all resumes that contain it will also be updated to
reflect the change.

*Examples:*

. Suppose we start with the following original list of resumes, as seen using the command `list i/ res`.
+

image::BeforeDeleteResumeList.png[width="790"]

. Deletes the 2nd resume with `delete 2 i/ res` .
+

image::ResumeDelete2.png[width="790"]

. Deletes the 3rd skill with `delete 3 i/ ski` . Do note how it is not a must for the list box to display skills for
deletion to proceed.
+

image::DeleteSkill3.png[width="790"]

// end::delete[]

// tag::view[]
=== Viewing an item in details: `view`

Shows the details of an item.

**Format:**
****
`view INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

[TIP]
The details of some item types like `proj` can only be viewed by using this command.

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `view 2 i/ proj`

*Outcome:*

. All project items are listed in the list panel.
+
image::ListProject2.png[width="790"]
. Using the `view` command, we can view the details of the project such as its website ("abc.github.io") and its description ("For a little module named CS2103T").
+
image::ViewDukeProject.png[width="790"]

// end::view[]

// tag::redit[]
=== Editing a resume: `redit`
Edits the resume to contain the items specified in the command.

[NOTE]
`redit` is a different command from `edit`. Please visit <<FAQ>> for more information.

**Format:**

****
`redit RESUME_INDEX TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...]]`
****
[TIP]
If you find it a hassle to manually enter items into the resume, you can consider using <<Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`, tagpull>>!

* For each `TYPE`, existing items will be updated to the input items.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a resume by chaining
`ITEM_INDEX` after `TYPE/`  e.g. `proj/ 3 6`, will add item of indices 3 and 6.
* You can remove all items of type `TYPE` by
typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_INDEX` after it.

*Examples:*

* `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ 1 ski/ 1 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain the internship item at index 1, project item at index 1, and skill item at indices 1 and 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditAddIntoResume.png[][AddIntoResume,442,337]


* `redit 1 int/ proj/ ski/` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain no internship, project, and skill items. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditRemoveEverything.png[][RemoveEverything,442,337]

* `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ ski/ 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain internship item at index 1, no project items, and skill item at index 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen (take note that initially the resume may contain other set of items entirely):

image::ReditWantSomeThings.png[][WantSomeThings,442,337]

// end::redit[]

// tag::tagpull[]
=== Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`

Pull the internship, project and skill items with the specified tag(s) into a resume.

**Format:**

****
`tagpull INDEX [#/ TAG]`
****

This command does not remove items from the resume and will add items on top of existing items.

Examples:

* `tagpull 1 #/ tech` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It will find all the internship, project, and skill items with the tag `tech` and adds it into the resume.

* `tagpull 2 #/ tech frontend` +
This command modifies the resume at index 2. It will find all the internship, project, and skill items which has either the tag `tech` or `frontend` and adds it into the resume.

// end::tagpull[]

// tag::undo[]

=== Undo a command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.

**Format:**

****
undo
****

Commands that can be undone are: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, and `me`.

Successive undo commands will bring the application further back, until there is no more change to undo.

[NOTE]
--
* An undo is done per command and not change.

* Commands that make no change to the application state, like `list` or `view`, cannot be undone.

* You cannot undo if there is no previous state to return to.
--

*Examples:*

. Suppose we hate Java and therefore want to delete it from the list of skills using a `delete 2 i/ ski` command. We
also do a `list i/ proj` to switch to viewing projects because this is how staging for an example works.
+

image::deleteJava_beforeUndo.png[width="790"]
+

image::beforeUndo_switchToProj.png[width="790"]

. But Stockholm's syndrome kicks in and we decide that Java has its merits, so we revert our action with `undo`.
Voila, Java is back, and our list box now displays skills.
+

image::postUndo_JavaIsBack.png[width="790"]

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]

=== Redo a command: `redo`

Reverts the most recent undone command and brings the application state to after the (re)execution
of that command.

**Format:**

****
redo
****

[NOTE]
--
* A redo is done per command and not change.

* If a new `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, or `me` command is performed after an undo, then all redo states will be deleted and you will not be able to go
to these states.
* You cannot redo if there is no forward state to go to.
--

*Examples:*

. After with the Java deletion incidence in the previous section (on `undo`), we decide that the merits of Java
do not warrant the pain that comes along with it and so we want to use `redo` our original choice . Afterwards, Java is
once again removed from our life.
+

image::redo_success.png[width="790"]

// end::redo[]

=== Previewing a resume: `rpreview`

Previews a resume in text format in a different window.

**Format:**
****
`rpreview INDEX`
****

[NOTE]
`INDEX` is with respect to the index seen when `list i/res` is called.

*Examples:*

* `rpreview 2` +
Shows preview of the resume with at index 2.

*Outcome:*

Suppose we run the above command using the so far used example program. `rpreview 2` will provide a text-based view of
the content of the resume named "Summer Internship".

image::RPreviewSummerInternship.png[width = "790"]

// tag::rgen[]

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a .pdf file from an existing resume stored inside the application at the specified index.

The exported `.pdf` file
will be located in the same folder as the application `.jar` file.

[NOTE]
A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing resume.

**Format:**

****
`rgen INDEX [n/ FILENAME]`
****

[TIP]
It is optional to specify a `FILENAME` for the .pdf file.
If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 1 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all resumes. Assuming that you want to generate the first resume in the list.
+
image::ListResume.PNG[width="790"]

. The second command generate a `My Resume.pdf` file from the specified resume. The screenshots of the generated file is as below:
+
image::GenerateResume.PNG[width="790"]
image::PdfFile.PNG[width="790"]

// end::rgen[]

=== Clearing all data: `clear`
Clears all data from ResuMe.

****
Format: `clear`
****

[WARNING]
This command cannot be undone. Please be careful when exercising this power.


=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

****
Format: `exit`
****

=== Saving the data
ResuMe data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`
_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
