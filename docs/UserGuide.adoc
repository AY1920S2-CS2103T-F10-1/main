== Introduction

Hello fellow University friends! Have you ever found writing resumes
for job and internship applications a hassle? Have you ever dreamt about
an app that can help you manage different resumes for different companies?
Have you ever wished for a more streamlined *Command Line Interface*
application that can match your efficiency and typing prowess?

If this sounds like you, *ResuMe* is _the_ resume managing application for you!
Made by University students for University students with _looovee_, this wonder
understands your struggle and strives to cater to your specific resume needs
and job application woes.

// end::intro-para[]

=== Overview
*ResuMe* allows the management of five different item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="^.^10%,^.^10%,^.^20%,.^60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Item type |Alias |Attributes
|1 |Internship |int |name, role, from, to, description, tag

|2 |Project |proj |name, time, website, description, tag

|3 |Skill |ski |name, level, tag

|4 |Resume |res |name, tag

|5 |Note |note |name, time, tag
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different `resumes` as well!
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different `resumes`.

=== Preview
The following is the GUI for our application:

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

====
*GUI Components:*

. *_Command box:_* where you enter your commands.

. *_Result box:_* where the result of a command is shown. It can show a success message or a failure
message if something wrong happens.

. *_View box:_* where the detailed information about an item is shown. For instance, if you are viewing an
`internship` item, this box shows in full the `company name`, `role`, `from`, `to`, `description` and `tags`.

. *_List box:_* where all items of a type are listed. Only one type is displayed at a time. You can change
the view of this list using `list` command. Additionally, when other commands change items of a type,
the list box will be set to display that type.

. *_User box:_* where you can view your personal information like `name`, `email`, or `phone number`. Any changes made
to your user profile will be automatically reflected here.

== About this guide
Our aim when writing this document is to help you - a new user - get started with *ResuMe* as quickly as possible.
The guide features all the available commands, their syntax, as well as specific examples for illustration.

This section is, well... a guide on how to use this guide :) We will be explaining some of the symbols and formatting used, key terms,
as well notes and tips for a better user experience.

=== Symbols and Formatting
Most of us are visual learners, and we figured, what is a better way to present information than using some shapes and colours?

[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Symbol / Format|Explanation
|icon:info-circle[role="blue"] | Important information to take note
|icon:lightbulb-o[role="yellow"] | Tips
|icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] | Warnings on potential misuse
|`consola font` | Keywords representing an `item type` or their `parameters`, or a `command` that could be executed
|=======================================================================

=== Key terms
You will come across these little guys a lot in this document, so let's get to know them first!
[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Explanation
|`type` | Consisting of five different types: `internship`, `project`, `skill`, `resume` and `note`
|`item` | An item stored in the application, which could be any one of the five types above
|`command` | A line of text that you could type into the command box and execute
|`parameter` | Specific information about an `item` supplied by you
|`index` | The position of the `item` in the currently displayed list
|=======================================================================

// end::guide[]

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `resumebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your *ResuMe* application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help start`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window for getting started.
.  Try out these example commands:

* **`list`**`i/ res` : lists all `resumes`.
* **`add`**`i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/ SE #/ frontend`: adds a `resume` named `Software Engineering Resume`
with `tags` _"SE"_ and _"frontend"_.
* **`delete`**`1 i/ res` : deletes the 1st `resume` shown in the resume list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you. +
For example, in `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME`, `TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be customised to be `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. +
 For example, `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
 For example, `[#/ TAG]...` can be used as:
** (i.e. 0 times)
** `#/ SE`
** `#/ SE #/ frontend` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
 For example, if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/ PHONE_NUMBER n/ NAME` is also acceptable.
====

// tag::help[]
=== Viewing help : `help`

Lists out the function and usage of each command.
====
*Format:* `help OPTION`
====

There are two possible `help` options that you can choose from, as shown in the table below:
[width="100%",cols="^.^15%,^.^15%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Format |Result
|command |`help command` |Opens a pop-up window with a summary of available commands, their syntax and usages.
|start |`help start` |Opens a pop-up window with detailed guide on how to get started.
|=======================================================================

These are screenshots of the two pop-up windows:

image::helpCommand.png[width="790"]

image::helpStart.png[width="790"]

// end::help[]

// tag::me[]
=== Editing user profile: `me`

Edits and updates user's display profile.

====
*Format:* `me [dp/ FILE_PATH] [n/ NAME] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [p/ PHONE_NUMBER] [e/ EMAIL] [g/ GITHUB] [u/ UNIVERSITY] [m/ MAJOR] [f/ FROM] [t/ TO] [c/ CURRENT_CAP MAX_CAP]`
====

[NOTE]
A user profile contains the following fields: `Display Picture`, `Name`, `Description`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Github`, `University`, `Major`, `From`, `To`, `CAP`.

*Example 1:* Update user profile details +

Try typing in the command box this command:

`me n/ My Name p/ 12345678 e/ test@gmail.com d/ I like solving problems and creating things! g/ mygithub u/ NUS m/ CS f/ 08-2018 t/ 05-2022 c/ 5.0 5.0`

*Outcome:*

The user box is updated accordingly as below:

image::ug.png[width="450"]

*Example 2:* Update user profile picture

Follow the steps in one of these two links to copy an absolute file path according to your respective Operating System.

. Mac: https://osxdaily.com/2013/06/19/copy-file-folder-path-mac-os-x/

. Windows: https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/show-full-folder-path-file-explorer

Afterwards, try a command similar to the one below:

`me dp/ /Users/nhamquochung/Desktop/test.png`

*Outcome:*

The user profile picture is updated accordingly as below:

image::ugu.png[width="450"]

// end::me[]

// tag::list[]
=== Listing all items : `list`

Lists items in the storage.

====
*Format:* `list i/ TYPE`
====

[TIP]
--
* Listed items are in short form, only showing their `index`, `name`, `tags` and a short summary.
To view items in full details, use <<Viewing an item in details: `view`, view>>.
* The type of items listed will light up in orange.
--

*Examples:*

* `list i/ res`
Lists all `resume` items.
+
image::ListAllResumes.png[width = "450"]

* `list i/ int`
Lists all internship items.
+
image::ListAllInternships.png[width = "450"]

* `list i/ note`
Lists all note items.
+
image::ListAllNotes.png[width = "450"]


// end::list[]

// tag::add[]
=== Adding an item: `add`

Adds an item to the *ResuMe* application.

====
*Format:* `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
====

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="^.^12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `add i/ int n/ COMPANY_NAME r/ ROLE f/ FROM t/ TO d/ DESCRIPTION [#/ TAG]...`

|Project |`add i/ proj n/ PROJECT_NAME t/ TIME w/ WEBSITE d/ DESCRIPTION [#/ TAG]...`

|Skill |`add i/ ski n/ SKILL_NAME l/ LEVEL [#/ TAG]...`

|Resume |`add i/ res n/ RESUME_NAME [#/ TAG]...`

|Note |`add i/ note n/ NOTE_NAME t/ TIME [#/ TAG]...`
|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
--
* An item could have any number of tags _(including 0)_.
* There are three possible levels for a `skill` item: `ADVANCED`, `INTERMEDIATE` and `BASIC`.
* A newly added note will be automatically marked as `undone`.
--
[TIP]
The description of an item could be written in one paragraph (with *full stop* and a *space* after each sentence).
These sentences, when exported to `.pdf` format, will be automatically shown as individual bullet points!
_(refer to <<Generating a resume: `rgen`, rgen>> for more details)_

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `add i/ proj n/ Duke t/ 06-2020 w/ abc.github.io d/ For a little module named CS2103T. #/ java #/ tech`

*Outcome:*

. All `project` items are listed in the list box.
+
image::ListProject.png[width="600"]
. A new `project` item named `Duke` with the specified fields is added. This item is automatically reflected in the list box.
+
image::AddDukeProject.png[width="600"]

// end::add[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Editing an item : `edit`

Edits an existing item in the *ResuMe* application.

[NOTE]
`edit` is a different command from `redit`. Please visit <<FAQ, FAQ>> for more information.

====
*Format:* `edit INDEX i/ TYPE [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
====


[width="100%",cols="^.^16%,84%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship |`edit INDEX i/ int [n/ COMPANY_NAME] [r/ ROLE] [f/ FROM] [t/ TO] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [#/ TAG]...`

|Project |`edit INDEX i/ proj [n/ PROJECT_NAME] [t/ TIME] [w/ WEBSITE] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [#/ TAG]...`

|Skill |`edit INDEX i/ ski [n/ SKILL_NAME] [l/ LEVEL] [#/ TAG]...`

|Resume |`edit INDEX i/ res [n/ RESUME_NAME] [#/ TAG]...`

|Note |`edit INDEX i/ note [n/ NOTE_NAME] [t/ TIME] [#/ TAG]...`
|=======================================================================


*Example 1:*
Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ res`
. `edit 1 i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/ agile`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists all `resume` items in the list box. Assuming you want to edit the `resume` item at index 1.
+
image::ListResume2.png[width="790"]

. The second command edits the `resume` item at index 1. It has its name changed from _"Winter 2019"_ to _"Software Engineering Resume"_ and its tag set to _"agile"_.
+
image::EditResumeExample.png[width="790"]

*Example 2:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ ski`
. `edit 2 i/ ski l/ ADVANCED #/`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists all `skill` items in the list box. Assuming you want to edit the `skill` item at index 2.
+
image::ListSkill1.png[width="790"]

. The second command edits the `skill` item at index 2. It has its level changed to from `INTERMEDIATE` to `ADVANCED` and all its existing tags cleared.
+
image::EditSkillExample.png[width="790"]
// end::edit[]

// tag::find[]

=== Finding items by name: `find`

Finds items of a specific `type` in the corresponding list of items whose names contain the specified keyword(s).

====
*Format:* `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ TYPE`
====

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="^.^12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ int`

|Project |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ proj`

|Skill |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ ski`

|Resume |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ res`

|Note |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ note`
|=======================================================================

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `find Orbital i/ proj`

*Outcome*

. All `project` items are listed in the list box. A sample project list is shown below.
+

image::list-orbital.png[width="790"]

. `Projects` whose names match keywords are listed in the list box.
+

image::find-orbital.png[width="790"]

// end::find[]

// tag::delete[]

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an existing item from the *ResuMe* application.

====
*Format:* `delete INDEX i/ TYPE`
====

[NOTE]
--
* The `INDEX` argument comes before the `TYPE` argument.
* Deleting an item will set the list box to display items of that type.
* All `resume` items that contain the deleted item will also be updated to reflect the change.
--

[TIP]
Use `list` command to navigate to the correct list to ensure that 1) the item exists, and 2) you know the
correct `index` for deletion. Or just fall back on `undo` if you accidentally delete the wrong item.

*Example:*

. Suppose we start with the following original list of `resume` items, as seen using the command `list i/ res`. Pay attention
to the second `resume` item.
+

image::BeforeDeleteResumeList.png[width="790"]

. Delete the 2nd `resume` with `delete 2 i/ res` .
+

image::ResumeDelete2.png[width="790"]

. Delete the 3rd `skill` with `delete 3 i/ ski` . Do note how it is not a must for the list box to display `skill` items for
deletion to proceed. After the deletion the list box is set to show `skill` items.
+

image::DeleteSkill3.png[width="790"]

// end::delete[]

// tag::sort[]

=== Sorting an item list : `sort`

Sorts an item list in the *ResuMe* application.

====
*Format:* `sort i/ TYPE order/ SORT_ORDER [reverse/ TRUE_OR_FALSE]`
====

[NOTE]
--
* The default sort order is ascending. You can specify `reverse/` to reverse this order.
So use `reverse/ true` if you want to sort in descending order, and `reverse/ false` if you
just like to type.

* Sorting an item list will set the list box to display items of that type.
--
[TIP]
--
* <<Modifying the content a resume: `redit`,`redit`>> can be very potent when used in conjunction with
`sort`. Sort internships by latest, then call `redit` with `int/ 1 2 3` to add the three most
recent internships to a resume. So easy!
--

* For the selected `TYPE`, the list of items of that type will be sorted according to
`SORT_ORDER` (see the note above for what  `reverse/` does).

* Below is the list of criteria by which different item types can be sorted:

[width="100%",cols=3*,options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Item type |`SORT_ORDER` |Criterion
|`internship` |`name` |Name of `internship`
|`internship` |`time` |Start date of `internship`
|`project` |`name` |Name of `project`
|`project` |`time` |Date of `project`
|`skill` |`name` |Name of `skill`
|`skill` |`level` |Level of proficiency of `skill`
|`resume` |`name` |Name of `resume`
|`note` |`name` |Name of `note`
|`note` |`time` |Deadline of `note`
|=======================================================================


*Example:*

. Sort all `resume` items by their name in ascending order with `sort i/ res order/ name`.
+

image::SortResByName.png[width="790"]

. Sort all `skill` items in descending level of proficiency with `sort i/ ski order/ level reverse/ true` .
+

image::SortSkiByLevelReverse.png[width="790"]

. Sort all `internship` by their start date in ascending order with `sort i/ int order/ time reverse/ false`, specifying
`reverse/` this time because we really like to type.
+

image::SortIntByTime.png[width="790"]

// end::sort[]

// tag::view[]
=== Viewing an item in details: `view`

Shows the detailed view of an item.

====
*Format:* `view INDEX i/ TYPE`
====

[TIP]
Certain details of specific items, for example the `website` and `description` of a `project` can only be viewed by using this command.

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `view 1 i/ proj`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all the `project` items in the list box. Assuming you want to view the details of the `project` item at index 1.
+
image::ListProject2.png[width="790"]
. The second command shows full details of the `project` at index 1, displayed in the view box. These includes details that were not shown in the list box, such as its website (_"github.com/zheng-code/detask"_) and its description (_"An all-in-one task managing app."_).
+
image::ViewDetaskProject.png[width="790"]

// end::view[]

// tag::redit[]
=== Modifying the content a resume: `redit`
Modifies the content of a `resume` to contain the items specified in the command.

[NOTE]
`redit` is a different command from `edit`. Please visit <<FAQ, FAQ>> for more information.

====
*Format:* `redit RESUME_INDEX TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...]]...`
====

[TIP]
If you find it a hassle to manually enter items into the `resume`, you can consider using <<Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`, tagpull>>!

* For each `TYPE`, existing items will be updated to the input items.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a `resume` by chaining
`ITEM_INDEX` after `TYPE/`. +
  For example `proj/ 3 6`, will add `project` item of indices 3 and 6 to the `resume`.
* You can remove all items of type `TYPE` by typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_INDEX` after it.

*Example 1: Adding items into a new resume*

Before you try this example, ensure you have added at least one `internship`, one `project`, and two `skill` items. You may verify for their presence by using the `list` command.

Type in these commands:

. `list i/ res`
. `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ 1 ski/ 1 2`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming you want to modify the contents of the first `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ReditListRes.png[width = "790"]

. The second command modifies the `resume` at index 1, named "Winter 2019". The `resume` now contains the `internship` item at index 1,
`project` item at index 1, and `skill` items at indices 1 and 2. The following screenshot illustrates what happens after this command:
+
image::ReditAddIntoResume.png[width = "790"]

*Example 2: Modifying the contents of the resume*

Following from example 1, you realise that you actually wanted to use a different set of items for your "Winter 2019" `resume`. Here is how you can rectify this!

Before you try this example, ensure you have added at least one `internship` and three `skill` items. You may verify for their presence by using the `list` command.

Type in these commands:

. `list i/ res`
. `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ ski/ 3`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming you want to modify the contents of the first `resume` in the list box. Since we are following from example 1, the "Winter 2019" `resume` would already have some items in it.
+
image::ReditListRes2.png[width = "790"]

. Before the second command, the `resume` contains the same set of items as the one in example 1. The command modifies the `resume` at index 1, named "Winter 2019". The `resume` now still contains the `internship` item at index 1, no `project` items, and `skill` item at index 3. The following screenshot illustrates what happens after this command:
+
image::ReditWantSomeThings.png[width = "790"]

You can think of this command as using only the items that has been specified in the command. In this example, we no longer want the items we have previously added, and we would like the "Winter 2019" `resume` to contain only the first internship item and the third skill item.

*Example 3: No modifications to `internship` and `skill` items*

Following from example 2, you are now satisfied with the `internship` and `skill` items, but you would like to add a `project` item without changing the `internship` and `skill` items. Here is how you can do it!

Before you try out this example, ensure you have at least two `project` items.

Type in these commands:

. `list i/ res`
. `redit 1 proj/ 2`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming you want to modify the contents of the first `resume` in the list box. Since we are following from example 2, the "Winter 2019" `resume` would already have some items in it.
+
image::ReditListRes3.png[width = "790"]

. Before the second command, the `resume` contains the same set of items as the one in example 2. The command modifies the `resume` at index 1, named "Winter 2019". The `resume` will now contain the the `project` item at index 2. The `internship` and `skill` items remain unchanged. The following screenshot illustrates what happens after this command:
+
image::ReditKeepSomeThings.png[width = "790"]

So by leaving out one of the prefixes (`TYPE/ ITEM_INDEX...`) from the command, you can keep some of the items in your `resume`!


// end::redit[]

// tag::tagpull[]
=== Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`

Pull all the `Internship`, `Project` and `Skill` items with the specified tag(s) into a `resume`.

====
*Format:* `tagpull RESUME_INDEX [#/ TAG]...`
====

[NOTE]
This command does not remove items from the `resume` and will add items on top of the existing items.

*Example 1: Pulling items using one tag*

Before you try this example, ensure you have added some items with the tag `SE`. You may verify for their presence by using the `list` command.

Type in these commands:

. `list i/ res`
. `tagpull 1 #/ SE`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming you want to modify the contents of the first `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ReditListRes.png[width = "790"]

. The second command pulls all items which has `SE` as the tag into the `resume` at index 1, named "Winter 2019". The following screenshot illustrates the outcome of the command if we have 1 `internship` item and 2 `project` items tagged with `SE`.
+
image::TagPullOneTag.png[width = "790"]

*Example 2: Pulling items using multiple tags*

Before you try this example, ensure you have added some items with the tag `SE` and/or `github`. You may verify for their presence by using the `list` command.

Type in these commands:

. `list i/ res`
. `tagpull 1 #/ SE #/ github`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming you want to modify the contents of the first `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ReditListRes.png[width = "790"]

. The second command pulls all items which has `SE` _or_ `github` as the tag into the `resume` at index 1, named "Winter 2019". The following screenshot illustrates the outcome of the command if we have 1 `internship` item and 2 `project` items tagged with `SE`, and 1 `skill` item tagged with `github`.
+
image::TagPullMultiTags.png[width = "790"]

// end::tagpull[]

// tag::undo[]

=== Undoing a command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.

====
*Format:* `undo`
====

[NOTE]
--
* An `undo` is done per command and not change. If you make multiple changes to your user profile,
for instance, using a single `me` command, then `undo` will revert all the changes.

* Commands that can be undone are: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `sort`, `redit`, `tagpull` and `me`.

* Commands that make no change to the application state, namely `list`, `view`, `find`, `rpreview` and `rgen`, cannot be undone.

* Successive `undo` commands will bring the application further back, until there is no more change to `undo`.

* You cannot `undo` if there is no previous state to return to.
--

*Example:*

. Suppose we hate Java and therefore want to delete it from the list of `skill` items using a `delete 1 i/ ski` command. We
also do a `list i/ proj` to switch to viewing projects because that is how staging for an example works.
+

image::deleteJava_beforeUndo.png[width="790"]
+

image::beforeUndo_switchToProj.png[width="790"]

. But Stockholm's syndrome kicks in and we decide that Java has its merits, so we revert our action with `undo`.
Voila, Java is back, and our list box now displays `skill` items.
+

image::postUndo_JavaIsBack.png[width="790"]

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]

=== Redoing a command: `redo`

Redoes the most recent undone command and brings the application state to after the (re)execution
of that command.

====
*Format:* `redo`
====

[NOTE]
--
* A `redo` is done per command and not change. If you undo a command that can make multiple changes like
`redit`, then redoing it will resurrect all the changes. Spooky!

* If a new `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `sort`, `redit`, `tagpull` or `me` command is performed after an `undo`,
then all states currently available for `redo` will be erased and you will not be able to go to these states
anymore.

* You cannot `redo` if there is no forward state to go to.
--

*Example:*

After the Java deletion incidence in the previous example section (for <<Undo a command: `undo`, `undo`>>), we
decide that the merits of Java do not warrant the pain it wreaks so we want to `redo` our original decision to delete
Java. Once again, Java is removed from our life.

=== Previewing a resume: `rpreview`

Previews a `resume` in text format in a pop-up window.

====
*Format:* `rpreview RESUME_INDEX`
====

[NOTE]
--
* `RESUME_INDEX` is the index of the `resume` seen when `list i/res` is called.
* `description` of `internship` and `project` is automatically separated into bullet points when the program detects full sentences.
--

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rpreview 2`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming that you want to preview the second `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ListResumeRPreview.png[width="790"]

. The second command will preview the `resume` at index 2 named "Software Engineering". A pop-up window will be opened,
featuring a text-based view of the content of "Software Engineering". The screenshots of the results are as shown below:
+
image::RPreview.png[width = "790"]
image::RPreviewIndexTwo.png[width = "790"]

// end::rpreview[]

// tag::rgen[]

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a `.pdf` file from an existing `resume` stored inside the application at the specified index.

====
*Format:* `rgen RESUME_INDEX [n/ FILE_NAME]`
====

* A valid `RESUME_INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing `resume`.
* The exported `.pdf` file
will be located in the same folder as the application `.jar` file.

[TIP]
It is optional to specify a `FILE_NAME` for the .pdf file.
If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 1 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming that you want to generate the first `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ListResume.PNG[width="790"]

. The second command generates a `My Resume.pdf` file from the specified resume. The screenshots of the application view
and of the generated file are as below:

=== Mark a note as done: `done`
Mark a `Note` at a specific index from the current note list as `done`.

====
*Format:* `done INDEX`
====

* A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing `note`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ note`

. `done 1`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `notes`. Assuming that you want to mark the first `note` in the list as `done`.
+
image::ListAllNotes.png[width="450"]

. The second command marks this `note` as done, by updating the tick box.

=== Saving the data
*ResuMe* data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`
We are currently working on a login feature that will let you set password for ResuMe. You will also be able to have
your locally stored data encrypted, so that no one (even us) can gain access to your precious information.

We value your privacy and we want you to feel safe. Stay tuned!
