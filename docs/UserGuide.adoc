== Introduction

*ResuMe* is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing
resumes*. More importantly, *ResuMe* is *optimized for those who prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
*ResuMe* can get your resume management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, `Quick Start`
to get started. Enjoy!

ResuMe allows management of different items and they must be one of the
4 item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="10%,10%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Alias |Item type |Attributes
|1 |int |internship |id, name, position, from, to, description, tag

|2 |proj |project |id, name, from, to, description, tag

|3 |ski |skill |id, name, level, tag

|4 |res |resume |id, name, description, tag
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different resumes as well.
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different resumes.

The following is the GUI for our application:

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `resumebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Resume Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`**`i/ res` : lists all resumes
* **`add`**`i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/SE #frontend`: adds a resume named `Software Engineering Resume`.
* **`delete`**`1 i/ res` : deletes the 1st resume shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME`,
`TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[\#/ TAG]...`
can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `#/ friend`, `\#/ friend`, `#/ family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE`,
`p/ PHONE_NUMBER n/ NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
----
Lists out the function and usage of each command.
----
Format: `help`

=== Listing all items : `list`
----
List items in the storage.
----
Format: `list i/ TYPE`

****

An item could be one of the four item types: `internship`, `project`, `skill` or even a `resume` itself.

****
Format: `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
****

[TIP]
An item could have any number of tags _(including 0)_.

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `add i/ int n/ COMPANY NAME r/ ROLE f/ FROM t/ TO d/ DESCRIPTION [#/ TAG]...`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

----
Edits an existing item in the ResuMe application.
----
Format: `edit INDEX i/ TYPE [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`


[width="100%",cols="16%,84%",options="header",]

|Skill |`edit INDEX i/ ski [n/ SKILL NAME] [l/ LEVEL] [#/ TAG]....`

|Resume |`edit INDEX i/ res [n/ NAME] [#/ TAG]...`
|=======================================================================

****
* Edits the item of type `TYPE` with the specified `ID`. The `ID` refers
to the unique identification number given to the item when it was first
added. The `ID` must be a *positive integer* that identifies an existing
item.
* At least *one* of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, existing tags of the person will be removed. i.e
adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove *all* the person’s tags by typing `#/` without
specifying any tags after it.
****
Examples:

* `edit 1 i/ res n/ Resume 1` +
Edits the name of the 1st resume to be `Resume 1`.
* `edit 2 i/ ski l/ ADVANCED #/` +
Edits the level of the 2nd skill to be `ADVANCED` and clears all existing tags.

=== Locating persons by name: `find`
----
Finds items in the ResuMe application whose names contain the specified keyword(s).
----
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* At least one keyword must be provided.
* The search is *case insensitive*. > e.g. orbital will match Orbital
* The *order* of the keywords does *not* matter. > e.g. Orbital CP2106
will match CP2106 Orbital
* If the `TYPE` is not specified. The program will search across *_all_*
items.
* Only *_full_* words will be matched. > e.g. CP210 will not match
CP2106*
****

Examples:

* `find Software` +
Returns `software` and `Software`
* `find Shopee Front-end` +
Returns any items having names `Shopee` or `Front-end`

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

----
Deletes an existing item in the ResuMe application
----
Format: `delete INDEX i/ TYPE`

****
* Deletes the item of type `TYPE` with the specified `INDEX`. The `INDEX`
refers to the index of the item in the respective item list. `INDEX` must be a valid index of the list.
* Once the item with the specified `INDEX` is deleted,
the list will automatically update to show the new indices of its items.
****

Examples:

* `delete 2 i/ res` +
Deletes the 2nd resume in the resume book.

=== Viewing an item in details: `view`

----
Shows all items in an existing resume.

Format: `view INDEX i/ TYPE`

Examples:

* `view 2 i/ res` +
View the 2nd resume in the resume book.

=== Editing a resume: `redit`
----
Edits an existing resume in the ResuMe application
----
Format:
`redit RESUME_ID TYPE/ [ITEM_ID...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_ID...]]... [#/ TAG]...`

****
* Edits the resume with the specified `RESUME_ID`. The `RESUME_ID`
refers to the unique identification number given to the item when it was
first added. The `ITEM_ID` and `RESUME_ID` must be a positive integer
that identifies an existing item of that type.
* The `TYPE` to be edited cannot be resume(`res`) and at least one
`TYPE` must be provided.
* For each `TYPE`, existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a resume by chaining
`ITEM_ID` after `TYPE/` e.g. `proj/ 123 109`
* You can remove all the resumes’ tags by typing `#/` without specifying
any tags after it. Similarly, you can remove all items of type `TYPE` by
typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_ID` after it.
****

Examples:

* `redit 135 proj/ 9823 int/ 102 201` +
Edits the resume of
`RESUME_ID` 135, overriding project content with project item of `ITEM_ID` 9823,
internship content with internship items of `ITEM_ID` 102 and 201.
Content of other item types in the resume remain unchanged.

* `redit 148 int/ proj/ ski/` +
Edits the resume of `RESUME_ID` 135,
overriding internship content, project content and skill content with empty string.
This effectively deletes all internship, project and skill items from the resume.
Content of other item types in the resume remain unchanged.

=== Undo a command: `undo`
****
* Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.
* Successive undo commands will bring the application state further back.
* Do note that commands that make no change to the application state, like `list` or `view`, cannot be undone.
* You cannot undo if there is no previous state to return to.
****

=== Redo a command: `redo`
****
* Redoes the immediately previous undone command and brings the application state to after the performing of that
command.
* If a new command is performed after `undo`, then all redo states will be deleted and you will not be able to go
to these states.
* You cannot redo if there is no forward state to go to.
****

=== Previewing a resume: `rpreview`

Previews the resume in text format.

****
Format: `rpreview INDEX`
****

Examples:

* `rpreview 2` +
Shows the text format of the resume with at index 2.

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a .pdf file from an existing resume stored inside the application at the specified index.

[NOTE]
A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing resume.

****
Format: `rgen INDEX [n/ FILENAME]`
****

[TIP]
It is optional to specify a `FILENAME` for the .pdf file.
If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 2 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all resumes. Assuming that you want to generate the first resume in the list.
