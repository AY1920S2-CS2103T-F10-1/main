== PROJECT: ResuMe

---

== Overview

ResuMe is a desktop application for you to manage all of your resumes from a centralised location. It is easy to build, customise and export different resume versions using only Command Line Interface.

== Summary of contributions

==== *Code contributed*:

[https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=variance&sortWithin=variance&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&since=2020-02-14&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=chrisjwelly&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional and Test code]] +

==== Enhancement implemented

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to modify items in the resume*: `redit`
** What it does: allows the user to selectively modify items in a specified resume.
** Justification: This is a key feature in the application because a user would need to select existing items in the resume to be included before generating them.
** Highlights: This enhancement is particularly tricky to implement due to the various possibilities of input that a user can give. Careful parsing of the input is required before the command is processed.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add items in the resume based on tags*: `tagpull`
** What it does: allows the user to add items that have been given a particular tag.
** Justification: This increases the convenience of modifying a resume, since items that have the same tags are likely to be included togehter in the resume.

* *Minor enhancement*: modified the `add` command and its parser to suit the application as it requires handling of various item types such as `Internship`, `Project` and `Skill` items. 

=== Contributions to team-based tasks:

==== Morphed CommandResult in overall architecture
* What it means: `CommandResult` has been separated to many different subclasses which correspond to the different `Command`.
* Justification: Several `CommandResult` require a special boolean value to indicate that it is the result of a certain `Command`. With only one class, the constructor would have to take in many booleans in the constructor and this gets very messy.

==== Project management
* Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub
* Managed GitHub issue tracker
* Set-up Travis and Coveralls
