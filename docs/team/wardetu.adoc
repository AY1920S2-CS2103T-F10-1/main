== PROJECT: ResuMe


== Overview

*ResuMe* is a desktop application to build and manage resumes. You can create resumes, add items
to resumes, and generate them with a handful of commands. The majority of interactions are via the Command Line Inteface
(CLI).

The project builds upon the code from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3)], a desktop Address Book application. ResuMe retains the characteristics of AB3 while
also having its own uniqueness. It is truly remarkable.

The project is done as part of

==== Enhancements implemented
* *Major enhancement*:
** Added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
*** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reverted using the redo command.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the application should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
*** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Planned *data encryption and log-in functionality*
*** These changes will come in a later version and will allow user better security when using ResuMe.
* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added *a sort function for items*
*** What it does: allows the user to sort an item based criteria like name or time.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly sort the items with a single command.
*** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
